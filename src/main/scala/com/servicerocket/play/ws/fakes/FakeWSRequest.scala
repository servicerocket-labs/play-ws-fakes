/** Fake implementation of WSRequest for testing purposes.

  * .expectContentType(toBe = FormUrlEncoded)
  * .expectBody(toBe = expectedBody)
  * .returning(fakeResponse)

  * it will verify these expectations automatically and will throw [[IllegalArgumentException]] if an expectation
  * fails to be verified. By ignoring expect methods and just using `returning` method you can skip this behavior.
