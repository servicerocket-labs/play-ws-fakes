Play WS Fakes
=============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ServiceRocket/play-ws-fakes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ServiceRocket/play-ws-fakes)

Fake Play WS request and responses for testing purposes.
### Usage
```
libraryDependencies += "com.servicerocket" %% "play-ws-fakes" % version
libraryDependencies += "com.typesafe.play" %% "play-ws" % version
```
Make sure to add a Play WS dependency explicitly,
if not already in the scope of your project, as none will be
provided transitively (provided scope).

Use in your tests:
```scala
import com.servicerocket.play.ws.fakes._
```
